Every developer dreams of reaching the senior level, but the path to this goal can be challenging and confusing. Creating a personal roadmap will help you visualize your journey, prioritize your efforts, and stay motivated throughout the process. In this article, we'll walk through a step-by-step guide to building your roadmap, starting with assessing your current skills and ending with a detailed development plan.

## Step 1: Assess Your Current Skills

The first step in creating your roadmap is to assess your current skills. To do this, we'll use a simple but effective exercise called "Skill Mapping".

### Instructions for Skill Mapping:

1. Create a map using Miro, Figma, or any other tool you prefer. You could clone this [Miro template](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVK22Ikc4=/?moveToWidget=3458764593638956646&cot=14) and start from there.

2. Take a look at semicircles "Foundation", "Growth" and "Horizon", this is where you will place your cards.

3. Fill the "Foundation" semicircle with cards representing the skills you already confidently possess. These are your core competencies that you can build upon.

4. In the "Growth" semicircle, add cards for the skills you are currently learning or plan to learn in the near future. These are the areas where you are actively improving.

5. In the "Horizon" semicircle, place cards for technologies and concepts you've heard about but don't yet know the details of. These represent potential areas for future exploration and learning.

6. Analyze 3-10 job postings for senior developers in your tech stack. Identify the most frequently mentioned skills and qualities, and add cards for them in the appropriate semicircles. Use this prompt for ChatGPT to extract the most important skills and qualities from the job postings:
   "Analyze the following job posting for a senior position. Extract the hard skills (technical skills, knowledge, and abilities) and soft skills (personal attributes, traits, and interpersonal skills) mentioned in the job requirements and qualifications sections. Present the findings in two separate lists: one for hard skills and another for soft skills.
   Job Posting:
   [Paste the job posting text here]"

7. Add cards for soft skills essential for senior developers. Use another color for cards so that they stand out. These could include communication, mentorship, and leadership.

By the end of this exercise, you'll have a clear visual representation of your current skill set, the areas you're actively working on, and potential future directions for your growth.

## Step 2: Transform Your Skill Map into a Roadmap

With your skill map complete, it's time to transform it into a actionable roadmap. In the next section, we'll guide you through the process of creating a timeline, prioritizing your learning, and setting milestones on your path to seniority.
