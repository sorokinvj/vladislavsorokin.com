## Hi there ğŸ‘‹

I am Vladislav, professional software developer, amateur artist,
beginner chess player and just a curious person living in a beautiful
Praia das Macas, ğŸ‡µğŸ‡¹. If you came here to hire me, here you could find
all the info needed - cv, portfolio and my developerâ€™s blog. If you
want to know me better, here you could read about me and what I
consider my current mission: to help entrepreneurs automate mundane
tasks, have more free time and enjoy life. You can find me
onÂ Twitter,Â GitHub or email me atÂ sorokinvj@gmail.com
