# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Vladislav, professional software developer, amateur artist,
beginner chess player and just a curious person living in a beautiful
Praia das Macas, ðŸ‡µðŸ‡¹

If you came here to hire me, [here]("/cv") you could find
all the info needed - cv and portfolio of recent works (coming soon).

If you want to know me better, I am planning to write about my interests.
Though I have experience in many professional areas, I am still trying to figure out who I am
and what is my mission. Currently, I am helping entrepreneurs to automate mundane
tasks and have more free time.

You can find me on [Twitter](twitter.com/sorokinvj),
[GitHub](github.com/sorokinvj) or email me at [sorokinvj@gmail.com](sorokinvj@gmail.com)
