# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Vladislav, professional software engineer, amateur artist,
beginner chess player and just a curious person living in a beautiful
Praia das MaÃ§Ã£s, ðŸ‡µðŸ‡¹

If you came here to hire me, [here](/assets/images/Vladislav_Sorokin_CV.pdf) you could find
all the info needed - cv and portfolio of recent works (coming soon).

I am also planning to write to my blog about my interests.
Though I have experience in many professional areas, I am still trying to figure out who I am
and what is my mission. Currently, I am helping entrepreneurs to automate mundane
tasks and have more free time.

You can find me on [Twitter](twitter.com/sorokinvj),
[GitHub](github.com/sorokinvj) or email me at <sorokinvj@gmail.com>
