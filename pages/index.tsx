        I am Vladislav, professional software developer, amateur artist,
        beginner chess player and just a curious person living in a beautiful
        Praia das Macas, Portugal. If you came here to hire me, here you could
        find all the info needed - cv, portfolio and my developerâ€™s blog. If you
        want to know me better, here you could read about me and what I consider
        my current mission: to help entrepreneurs automate mundane tasks, have
        more free time and enjoy life. You can find me onÂ Twitter,Â GitHub or
